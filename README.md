# review_app

A new Flutter project. 
- This is a basic app, that is used to learn the flutter implementation, and a lot is left to learn â›³ .


## Things I understood are:
- The `StatelessWidget` -> this is used when we are not using any state, like the widget is static, on user interaction it is not going to change.
- `super.key` -> this is essential for indentifying each individual widget in Widget tree ðŸŒ².
- `@override` -> this is must need because, in the flutter the `Widget` is already predefined its strucuture, so to manipulate to according to our needs. we use the **@override**.
- `Material App` -> provides a polished appearance.
- `Scaffold` -> this defines the layout on the screen.
- `StatefulWidget` -> this is used when we are storing or updating some values, according to the user interaction.
- Here we are defining a state using `createState()` for the class we are using further.
- `setState() {}` -> we are also using the setState which is essential for updating the state or the value.
- For the bottom popup, we are using `BottomSheet`.
- And some other stuff, like styling, padding etc....., and a __simple logic for showcasing the suggested keywords according to the user's star rating__.
